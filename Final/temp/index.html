      <h1>SNHU Assignment</h1>
        <p>In this assignment I have created a portal of sorts that will allow CallWorks customers to access our ticketing system and check on the status of their tickets. When you navigate to the "Tickets" page, you will find a simple input where you can enter the ticket number and it will return limited information about your issue. On the backend, I will be using Jquery to make a REST API call into our ticketing system. Once the JSON data is populated, I will extract limited fields and return the current status of the issue.</p>
      
        <p>In the "Known Issues" page is a simple table containing frequent issues seen within our application. We list the customer ticket number, our internal ticket, along with the description and an expected releasedate. The "Knowladge Base" is a simple referance to software release notes and any other pertanit data that our customer might like or need access to.</p>
      
        <p>The "Contact Us" page is just what it sounds like. Here our customers will be able to send our support personal an email reporting an issue or inquary they have. This will send an email to support and initieat the process</p>
